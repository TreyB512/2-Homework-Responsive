  <h1 align="Center" style="color:white;">Welcome to My website! </h1>

  <h2 style="color:white;">About Me</h2>

  <p style="color:white;">
    Hey guys, my name is Cleo Brooks and I am a Junior at Texas State
    University. I am a Mass Communications Digital Media major with a minor in
    computer science and this website is all about me.
  </p>
  <p style="color:white;">
    I grew up in East Texas in a small town known as Lufkin, Tx. I'm 21 years old
    and more than likely seen most of yal at the square.
    My hometown may be small in population, but we are widely known for our
    great football program.
    Big time athletes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dez_Bryant"
     style="color:red;" target="_blank">
      Dez Bryant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Coutee"
      style="color:red;" target="_blank">
        Keke Coutee</a> are few of the great athletes that come out of
        Lufkin.
  </p>
  <p style="color:white;">
    I came to school down here due to the great location and because I have
    a good amount of family members here if I ever need them.
    This is my 3rd year now living in <a href="https://www.sanmarcostx.gov/"
    style="color:red;" target="_blank">
      San Marcos, Tx</a> and I've enjoyed every bit of it.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:white;">Hobbies</h2>
    <p style="color:white;">
      On my days off from work I enjoy:
      <ol style="color:white;">
        <li>Photographing</li>
        <li>Playing basketball</li>
        <li>Listening to Music</li>
        <li>Xbox</li>
      </ol>

      <p style="color:white;">
        When I'm not in class I have a job working at San Marcos Nike
        factory store at the <a href="https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/san-marcos"
         style="color:red;" target="_blank">Premium Outlets.</a> I've been there for around 2 years and really love
        the atmosphere of working with other college students who enjoy some of
        the things I like.

      <h2 style="color:white;">Photography</h2>

      <p style="color:white;">
        I am no expert at all "yet" in photgraphy, but I've learned a great amount
        of knowledge about it and can get some pretty great shots.
        If interested
        in my work and need senior photos. You can contact me from my Twitter below.
