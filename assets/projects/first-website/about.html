  <h2 align="left">About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I grew up in deep East Texas in a small town known as Lufkin, Tx. Even
    though Lufkin may be  small in population size, we are widely known for our
    great sports program, especially football. Big time athletes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dez_Bryant"
     style="color:red;" target="_blank">
      Dez Bryant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keke_Coutee"
      style="color:red;" target="_blank">
        Keke Coutee</a> are few of the many great athletes that come out of
        Lufkin.
    Like the average American, I grew up in a household surrounded by sports.
    Basketball, track and field, football, you name it I played it. Around my
    Sophomore year in high school, I got a job at Best Buy working in the computer
    department and cameras section for a little over two years. This is how I got
    into technology and photography. Astonished at how much I never knew about
    everything tech; I had to learn more. This became a big reason why I choose my
    major and minor. I still get excited knowing there is more
    to learn and can not wait to see where my journey ahead takes me.

  <p>
    I came to school down here due to the great location and because I have
    a good amount of family members here if I ever need them.
    This is my 3rd year now living in <a href="https://www.sanmarcostx.gov/"
    style="color:red;" target="_blank">
      San Marcos, Tx</a> and I've enjoyed every bit of it.

        When I'm not in class I have a job working at San Marcos Nike
        factory store at the <a href="https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/san-marcos"
         style="color:red;" target="_blank">Premium Outlets.</a> I've been there for around 2 years and love
        the atmosphere of working with other college students who enjoy similar things as me.
