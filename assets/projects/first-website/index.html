  <p>
    Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Cleo Brooks III and I am a Junior at Texas State
    University. I am a mass communications digital media innovation major with a minor in
    Computer science. I started my college career at Texas State and plan
    to finish here as well in the upcoming fall of 2019. Through my time at Texas State,
    I’ve taken classes in many different fields. This includes physical therapy studies,
    radiational therapy, and exercise and sports management. After going through all
    these different programs, I’m glad I can say I found the best one in the digital media.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is my 3rd year now at Texas State and I'm loving every bit. I choose my
    major and minor in hopes of landing a Web developing job near Austin. I’m still
    just getting my feet wet in the world of coding, but with more learning and
    practicing there’s not limits in what could be done.

When I was younger I dealt with multiple
surgeries due to a broken femur from playing city league football. From this unlucky
injury. I attended physical therapy for a couple of months. It was bumpy at first
being I was a lazy 12-year-old kid at the time, but the wonderful therapist I worked
with through the process made everything worth it. In turn, I choose Texas State
Physical Therapy program and began taking classes my spring freshman year. Everything
was going great, then around my Sophomore year I ended up changing my major
to radiation therapy after realizing I did not want to go to school an extra four years
for PT school. I switched to radiation therapy major for a semester when afterwards I
realized how much I really missed technology and got introduced to coding by a friend.
About a week later I discovered the new digital media program Texas state just added
as a major. So here I am now. At the end of my Junior year with no regrets on the
decision I made.
